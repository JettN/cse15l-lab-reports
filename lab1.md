## Installing VScode
To log into a course-specific account on ieng6, you need to install Visual Studio Code, or VScode, on your computer; however, I already had VScode installed on my personal device so I did not need to do this. Once installed and opened, you should be able to see a screen like this.

If you are on Windows like I am, you need to install [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) (*make sure to select VS CODE as Gitâ€™s default editor when installing Git*) and follow [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994) to use git bash in VScode.

## Remotely Connecting
After selecting Git Bash as your default profile for your terminal on VScode, type `ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, replacing zz with the letters in your account. You may receive a message asking if you want to continue connecting, to which you can respond with yes. Then, enter your password after being prompted to do so (*you will not be able to see your password when you type it*).

## Trying out Some Commands
After you have logged in, you can now test some commands such as cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, and cp to familiarize yourself with them. Feel free to type `help _____` in the terminal, filling in the blank with the command you want to know about, to see how to use different commands.
